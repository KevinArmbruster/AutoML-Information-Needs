# Human-in-the-Loop AutoML: Information Needs and Usage Patterns


## Motivation

The initial idea of AutoML was full, end-to-end automation. This "black-box" approach often falls short, as practitioners value the ability to gain insights, maintain control, and interactively guide the model development process.
However, many AutoML tools are not designed for human-in-the-loop interaction. Their focus on one-shot optimization creates a lack of support for real-world workflows, leading to suboptimal search spaces, poor interpretability, and wasted resources.

This workshop is about understanding the goals and information needs along the ML pipeline in human-in-the-loop AutoML workflows.


## Goal

We want AutoML tools that better support iterative and interactive model development of practitioners.

Our long-term goal is to help design AutoML tools that:
- **Support human-in-the-loop workflows** instead of assuming full automation
- **Make relevant information accessible when you need it**
- **Adapt to the iterative process of model development**


## Targeted Results

For this, we need to better understand how practitioners like you actually use AutoML tools — not as a means of full automation, but as a tool for exploration, learning, and decision-making in your workflow.

We aim to uncover:
- **What information you need** when working with AutoML tools
- **Why you need it** — what decisions it helps you make
- **When you need it** — at which stages in your workflow across the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md) and possibly iterations inside a stage
- **How you find it** — whether from the tool, experimentation, or other means

We structure this in a collection of patterns defining the goals, information needs and the relevant context.
The pattern is demonstrated in this [template](Template.md) and this [example](Example.md).


## Getting Started

### Web Editor

You can open a GitHub repository in the github.dev editor in your browser by pressing . (dot).


### Creating Patterns

Please copy and start working on your first pattern using this [template](workshop/Template.md)! Please use the [template](workshop/Template.md) and an [example](workshop/Example.md) to articulate your goals and information needs.


### Ideation

It can help to think of a specific past project of yours. Try to remember the stages from start to finish along the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md).

* What goals did you persue in each stage or in general?
* Did you iterate over certain stages?
* What decisions did you take?
* What information was necessary to take a further step?

There are no wrong answers! We are very interested in your personal experiences, what you have learned so far, when you apply this knowledge and how it has payed off for you.
If you are unsure where to write down certain information feel free to write it to the seemingly most appropriate point — do not skip it if it feels important.
