# Human-in-the-Loop AutoML: Goals and Information Needs

If you want, feel free to scan a summarized [project description](Project%20Description.md), including the motivation, goals and targeted results.


## Getting Started

### Web Editor

You can open this GitHub repository in the github.dev editor in your browser by pressing . (dot).


### Creating Patterns

Go to the ``workshop`` folder to copy and start working on your first pattern using this [template](workshop/Template.md).
Please use the [template](workshop/Template.md) and an [example](workshop/Example.md) to articulate your goals and information needs.


### Ideation

It can help to think of a specific past project of yours. Try to remember the stages from start to finish along the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md).

* What goals did you persue in each stage or in general?
* Did you iterate over certain stages?
* What decisions did you take?
* What information was necessary to take a further step?

There are no wrong answers! We are very interested in your personal experiences, what you have learned so far, when you apply this knowledge and how it has payed off for you.
If you are unsure where to write down certain information feel free to write it to the seemingly most appropriate point â€” do not skip it if it feels important.


### Commiting and Creating a Pull Request

At the end of creating patterns and before reviewing:

1. Commit all your changes into the main branch of your forked repository.
2. Open your own forked repository ``AutoML-Research / automl-information-need-patterns-*name*``.
3. Open ``Pull Requests`` > Select ``New Pull Request``> Select ``Compare accross forks``.
4. Select the base repository as ``AutoML-Information-Needs-Classroom``. The head repository is already your own fork ``AutoML-Research / automl-information-need-patterns-*name*``.
5. Select ``Create Pull Request`` > Add your group name as the title > Select ``Create Pull Request``.
6. You are ready to review! Navigate to Pull Requests in [AutoML-Information-Needs-Classroom](https://github.com/AutoML-Research/AutoML-Information-Needs-Classroom/pulls).
