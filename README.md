# AutoML Information Need Patterns

## Goal

Our goal is to inform the design of future AutoML tools that better support expert workflows. AutoML tools are powerful but at times stiff, opaque and complex tools. We're here to explore how experts like you actually use these tools—not just to automate, but to understand. Through our focus group discussion, we aim to understand what information you seek, how you find it, and why it is essential to your workflow when developing machine learning models. 

We want to consider the decisions you make across most of the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md), from data preparation to model validation. Crucially, we also want to understand the iterative nature of your work—how your strategy evolves from an initial, broad exploration to a more focused, refined search in subsequent runs.

This is not an academic exercise—your insights will directly shape the next generation of human-centered AutoML tools. By sharing your experience, you're helping design AutoML systems more aligned with expert workflows.

## Targeted Results

We want to create a collection of information need patterns - which is just a predefined format to make analyzing, refining and applying these information needs easier in the future.

Information need patterns should describe the context, when this information need is relevant, which information is needed, how you acquire the information and your goal why you need certain information.

To make it easier to work with, we created a [template](Template.md) and an [example](Example.md).

## Getting Started

Please start to create your own directory in the workshop folder.
Then, copy and start working on your first pattern using this [template](Template.md)!

It can help to think of a specific past project of yours. Try to remember the stages from start to finish along the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md). Which goals did you persue in each stage or in general? Did you iterate over certain stages? Which decisions did you take? Which information was necessary to take a further step?

There are no wrong answers! We are very interested in your experiences, what you have learned so far, when you apply this knowledge and how it has payed off for you.
If you are unsure where to write down certain information feel free to write it to the seemingly most appropriate point, do not skip it if it feels important.

## Commit your Patterns

Don't forget to commit your patterns every so often, and especially before you sign off!
