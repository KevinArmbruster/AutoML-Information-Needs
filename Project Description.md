## Motivation

The initial idea of AutoML was full, end-to-end automation. This "black-box" approach often falls short, as practitioners value the ability to gain insights, maintain control, and interactively guide the model development process.
However, many AutoML tools are not designed for human-in-the-loop interaction. Their focus on one-shot optimization creates a lack of support for real-world workflows, leading to suboptimal search spaces, misinterpretation of results, and wasted resources.

This workshop is about understanding the goals and information needs along the ML pipeline in human-in-the-loop AutoML workflows.


## Goal

We want AutoML tools that better support iterative and interactive model development of practitioners.

Our long-term goal is to help design AutoML tools that:
- **Support human-in-the-loop workflows** instead of assuming full automation
- **Make relevant information accessible when you need it**
- **Adapt to the iterative process of model development**


## Targeted Results

For this, we need to better understand how practitioners like you actually use AutoML tools — not as a means of full automation, but as a tool for exploration, learning, and decision-making in your workflow.

We aim to uncover:
- **What information you need** when working with AutoML tools
- **Why you need it** — what decisions it helps you make
- **When you need it** — at which stages in your workflow across the [ML Pipeline](ML%20Pipeline%20Overview.md) and possibly iterations inside a stage
- **How you find it** — whether from the tool, experimentation, or other means

We structure this in a collection of patterns defining the goals, information needs and the relevant context.
The pattern is demonstrated in this [template](Template.md) and this [example](Example.md).
